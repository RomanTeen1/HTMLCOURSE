            <h2>About Puerto Vallarta</h2>
            <p>Puerto Vallarta is a very popular and well known city amongst the hispanic community. It is a stunning resort town located on Mexico's Pacific coast in Jalisco state. Known for its spectacular beaches, marine life, water sports, and local resorts, Puerto Vallarta is one of the most popular vacation destinations in the world.
            <br><br>Puerto Vallarta was known as "Puerto Las Peñas" from 1851 until 1918 when it was designated as a municipally and received the official name of "Puerto Vallarta", in honor of Don Ignacio L. Vallarta, a reputable representative of the State of Jalisco at the time. For the next 20 years it remained a small fishing village.In the 1930s, Puerto Vallarta started to become a more popular tourist destination. However, it was in 1964 that Puerto Vallarta became famous, with the release of John Huston's movie version of Tennessee Williams' The Night of the Iguana. The movie showcased the beauty of Mismaloya Beach while the paparazzi publicized the adulterous affair between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton.<br><br> This publicity helped to attract foreign investors in the 1970s, which brought about the massive expansion of Puerto Vallarta. Another big hit film produced was the 1987 film Predator directed by John McTiernan and the main star being Arnold Schwarzenegger. The film was shot in El Éden. A beautiful tropical location where a statue of the predator still stands. And a restaurant that is near a lake where anyone can jump in and take a swim.</p>

            <p class="left-par">The little village of Mismaloya lies just south of Puerto Vallarta along Highway 200. This beach is famous because it’s where scenes from the 1963 Hollywood movie Night of the Iguana was filmed. This is the movie that thrust Puerto Vallarta into the spotlight where it quickly entered international consciousness. To get to this beach, look for the sign for the Barcelo Resort. The narrow road leading down to the beach runs along the south side of the resort complex. Mismaloya Beach wraps around the water in a lovely cove shaped like a U. From the beach visitors have a wonderful view of the famous Los Arcos granite rock formations which is a favorite location for scuba divers and snorklers. Along Mismaloya Beach there are vendors selling sun hats, beach toys and a variety of Mexican handicrafts. Conveniently, there are a few beachfront restaurants ready to serve cold beverages and delicious entrees. Loal fishermen launch their boats directly from the beach.</p>

                <p class="right-par">The beautiful town of Talpa de Allende in Jalisco is nestled in the Sierra Madre mountains, away from all the noise and activity in the tourist areas of Puerto Vallarta. This mining town is referred to as “pueblos magicos,” or magic villages, because of its cultural significance and preservation of history. When you enter the pueblos magico you will notice the phrase “La Calzada de las Reinas”. This translates to “a place that welcomes all pilgrims”. Every year thousands of families arrive in pilgrimage at the large church to pay respects to the virgin Rosario de Talpa. If you visit at the right time of year, you may get to witness the impressive procession, led by a band while all the bells of the church ring. The streets are lined with statues of the Virgin Mary for people to leave their offerings but only a few meters away is the main shrine.</p>

The movie starts off with the heroes arriving at Boca de Tomatlán beach, the rest of the movie was shot at El Edén, the restaurant that currently is there, the pools and surrounding jungle.</p>
