            <h2>Halo Series</h2>
            <p class="left-par">This video game series is one of my childhood games. Back in the early 2000's the first game of the series revolutionized the first person shooting game genre, where it would also include one of the best multiplayer and story driven games to this day.</p>

                <h2 id="LZ-title">Legend of Zelda Series</h2>
                <p class="right-par">My first introuduction to the Legend of Zelda series was twilight princess, which I would consider to be my favorite. Many of the Zelda games take you on an adventure that primarily deals with a boy name link who is set out to save the world from evil Ganon.</p>

            <h2>Mario Series</h2>
            <p class="left-par">Mario is an old time classic where it takes the player in unexplored maps to complete some objective. The Mario franchise has introduced new ways of exploring the world with different video game mechanics that are enjoyable to play with. Some of the Mario games I have played and thought were fun were: Mario Sunshine, Mario Bros. 3, Mario Kart, Mario Party, and Mario Galaxy.</p>

                <h2 id="GT-title">Gears of War Series</h2>
                <p class="right-par">The Gears of War Series growing up, was a favorite of mine back when the xbox 360 was around. It had multiplayer, couch co-op, and an alright story (but still worth playing). It is a very bloody, gory, and very thrilling fast pace game. Many of my cousins played it because of the military look and dark theme it had.</p>

            <h2>Street Fighter Series</h2>
            <p class="left-par">Back in the 2010's there were a few arcades that I would go to with my Dad to play many types of video games. One of these games we played was Street Fighter. A fighting game which also revolutionized the fighting game genre back in the 80's. Street fighter allowed the player to make up some interesting fighting combos to destroy your opponent. I really enjoyed the 1v1 aspect of video games, because no one-else intervines in the fight.</p>
